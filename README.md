# kotest-gradle-plugin

## Moved to main kotest repo

![build](https://github.com/kotest/kotest-gradle-plugin/workflows/build/badge.svg)

[Gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.kotest) for running JVM tests with Kotest. Requires Kotest 5.5.x or higher.

This is an alternative to using JUnit5 support and provides better output than the gradle default, especially for nested tests but should be considered alpha.


### How to use

Add the plugin to your gradle build file:

```kotlin
plugins {
     id("io.kotest") version "0.4.0"
}
```

Ensure your build has the kotest engine dependency and remove the junit5 dependency if this was in your build previously.

```kotlin
dependencies {
  testImplementation("io.kotest:kotest-assertions-core-jvm:$version")
  testImplementation("io.kotest:kotest-framework-engine-jvm:$version")
}
```

Then execute the tests at the command line using the `kotest` task.

```bash
./gradlew kotest
```

Or from within intellij under the gradle -> tasks -> verification -> kotest task.
